Lesson 2

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Initializes all of the files that are needed to manage your repository.
	This allows you to create, maintain, modify, and share your repository.
	
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
	repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area only shows the files that you select to be committed,
	whereas the working directory shows all files. The value offered is that
	you have complete control over what gets updated, when it gets updated,
	how it's updated, and why.
	
Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
	logical change?
A: You are able to compare the working directory to the staging area, as well
	as the staging area to the most recent commit, so it is very easy to 
	ensure there is only one logical change to the file.
