Lesson 2

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Initializes all of the files that are needed to manage your repository.
	This allows you to create, maintain, modify, and share your repository.
	
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
	repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area only shows the files that you select to be committed,
	whereas the working directory shows all files. The value offered is that
	you have complete control over what gets updated, when it gets updated,
	how it's updated, and why.
