Lesson 3

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: Mobility purposes, and data protection in the event of a system failure/other disaster.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manually pulling changes will reduce pull requests, and reduce the chance of pulling in
	a non-working or experimental version of your repository.
