Lesson 3

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: Mobility purposes, and data protection in the event of a system failure/other disaster.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Manually pulling changes will reduce pull requests, and reduce the chance of pulling in
	a non-working or experimental version of your repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
	instead of another?
A: Forks are clones of a repository that aren't directly associated with the original, meaning
	that changes to the fork will not update the original. Clones are direct copies of a 
	repository that get updated when there is a push. Branches are part of one repository that
	link back to the original, preserving the history of that repository. You would use forks when
	you want to use a repository but don't have the permission to modify the original. You would clone
	a repository so that you could modify it and update it at a different time. Branches would be
	useful to test new features or fix bugs.
	
Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: Maintain integrity if you have multiple collaborators, and you will have the ability to review
	the code in case a change creates a bug or some other issue.
	
Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be
	harder?
A: Email, thumb drives, and Google drive are all options to collaborate. Email and thumb drives would
	would be much harder, since the files won't be synchronized and it's a lot of legwork to get and
	maintain each iteration of a project. Google Drive would be similar to GitHub, although the setup
	may be a little easier to manage.
